        Developers are just common people, lazy and scared of changes. But they
        are also selfish and they have passion and desire to be happy.
        Sometimes they go crazy and do something they were told that it is not
        possible. Refactor and modernize an unmaintainable project. How?

        Did you know you can containerize your Jakarta EE, MicroProfile and
        Spring Boot applications to start up in milliseconds, without
        compromising on throughput, memory, development-production parity, or
        Java language features?  InstantOn with org.crac support enables rapid
        startup for native cloud apps.

        Loom brings virtual threads. You can have million of them: they are
        cheap to create and cheap to block. Consequence? Forget about your
        old asynchronous, callback based code. Improve your performances with
        simple, imperative, mono-thread, blocking code!
